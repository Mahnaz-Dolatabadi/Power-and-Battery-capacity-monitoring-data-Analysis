
## Project Overview
This project visualizes a dataset related to battery voltage and RY current readings over time. The dataset was analyzed using **Power BI** to explore trends, fluctuations, and patterns. The visualizations aim to provide insights into the behavior of battery voltage and RY current over a period of days.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard consists of two key visualizations:

1. **Median of RY Current by Time:**
   - **Y-axis**: Displays the median values of the RY Current over time.
   - **X-axis**: Represents the time period, starting from August 31st to September 3rd.
   - **Insights**: We observe consistent RY current values, with a sudden rise in RY current values starting around September 1st, peaking at 91 on September 2nd and continuing through September 3rd.

2. **Median of Battery Voltage by Time:**
   - **Y-axis**: Displays the median values of battery voltage over time.
   - **X-axis**: Represents the time period, aligning with the RY current chart.
   - **Insights**: Initially, the battery voltage remains relatively stable at around 6580-6493. After September 1st, the voltage decreases significantly, dropping to 2725 by September 2nd and stabilizing around 2730 by September 3rd.

## Key Insights
- **RY Current**: The RY current shows stable behavior at the beginning, with values ranging from 20 to 40. Around September 1st, the RY current starts rising and peaks around 91, indicating a significant increase in current activity.
- **Battery Voltage**: Initially, the battery voltage shows stability but drops significantly after September 1st, following a steep decline.

These visualizations help in understanding the relationship between the time series and the fluctuation in battery voltage and RY current over a period of days.


## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For creating the visualizations and dashboard.
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes RY current and battery voltage readings over time.
